Things TO-DO on PGME:

Bugs and Known Issues:

    Some DOSBox users have reported the time displayed in PGME and the Clock
    Screen Saver showing times like 26th hour of the day. This is not a bug
    in the time conversion routines in these programs.

	General perfomance enhancements.
	Restore all paths on exit.
	Do QDETUNE.
	Import of PMI from within PGME.
	Add prompting and parsing for custom options in menu launchers.
	Add PGME Value as Formatting to Options like %E for eternity path...
	    (for improved program launching flexibility)
	Change searching to search programs in order of appearance, not order of ID.
	Ticker style viewing of really long text when selected or mouse is over.

Todo Someday:

    Improve memory management and ETERNITY memory usage. (It wastes a lot)
	Add Auto-detect of CD/DVD insertion.
	Add more custom themes.
	Add Flip & Flop to EFNTDSGN.
	Add Ability to Click and Draw in EFNTDSGN.
	Make Reboot Utility.
	Multi-Language support inside installer.
	Add color attributes for disabled thumb toggle text.
    Add Read Ahead caching to cache file.
