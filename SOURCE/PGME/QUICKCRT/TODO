Things TO-DO on QCrt & PGME:


Current Build Instructions:

	requires Turbo Pascal 7 and TP7's BCC make utility (included in TP7 bin dir)

	make

Bugs and Known Issues:

	KeyPressed and Readkey are currently broken due to command translations.
	Get/Set File Time/Attr in QDos not working.
	Prevent TConfigFile AutoMerge getting from stuck in a loop if merging a previously
		merged file.
	Draw behind other windows, prob requires QCrt 9.
	
Maybe Eventual Improvements:
	
	Extention Component.
	Make KeyPressed and ReadKey translate Commands into Keypresses for backwards compatibility.	
	Buffered File I/O, mainly reading in TAbstractFile. Maybe buffered writes to.
	QCRT Get/Put Window, convert to optimized assembly.
	UI Window, resize and dragging	
	Move Non-visual stuff from TControl into TComponent.
	Error Dialog in TPathDialog when MakeDir fails.
	UN/Tab UI Navigation and other stuff for Mouseless systems. 
	Text Typing and special unhandled commands over Edit controls starts editing.
	Other general perfomance enhancements.
	Make PGM_Call into QIPC
	Add KeyValue Lookups to THelp.
	Enhance TTextView with Line Wrapping and Horizontal Scrolling.
	Add to TControl AdjustSize method for Aligning to Bottom when Anchored at Top. 
	Same goes for Aligning to Left when Anchored at Right.
	Also, change aligning method to align to sibling controls not just parent.
	
	Develop QCRT 9: (Would/Will be a major undertaking)
		Window drawing, not just screen drawing. 
		Better mouse Antiflicker that will test position and only hide if needed.

Todo PGME & QCrt: 

	Needed Controls.
		Tree View
		File Tree View
		Scroll Window
		Memo Edit
		Binary Tree
		MOTD

	More Special Effects
